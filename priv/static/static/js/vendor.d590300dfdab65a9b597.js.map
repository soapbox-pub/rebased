Here's an example chat room example where `\"new_msg\"`\n\t * events are listened for, messages are pushed to the server, and\n\t * the channel is joined with ok/error/timeout matches:\n\t *\n\t * ```javascript\n\t *     let channel = socket.channel(\"room:123\", {token: roomToken})\n\t *     channel.on(\"new_msg\", msg => console.log(\"Got message\", msg) )\n\t *     $input.onEnter( e => {\n\t *       channel.push(\"new_msg\", {body: e.target.val}, 10000)\n\t *        .receive(\"ok\", (msg) => console.log(\"created message\", msg) )\n\t *        .receive(\"error\", (reasons) => console.log(\"create failed\", reasons) )\n\t *        .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue...\") )\n\t *     })\n\t *     channel.join()\n\t *       .receive(\"ok\", ({messages}) => console.log(\"catching up\", messages) )\n\t *       .receive(\"error\", ({reason}) => console.log(\"failed join\", reason) )\n\t *       .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue. Still waiting...\") )\n\t *```\n\t *\n\t * ## Joining\n\t *\n\t * Creating a channel with `socket.channel(topic, params)`, binds the params to\n\t * `channel.params`, which are sent up on `channel.join()`.\n\t * Subsequent rejoins will send up the modified params for\n\t * updating authorization params, or passing up last_message_id information.\n\t * Successful joins receive an \"ok\" status, while unsuccessful joins\n\t * receive \"error\".\n\t *\n\t * ## Duplicate Join Subscriptions\n\t *\n\t * While the client may join any number of topics on any number of channels,\n\t * the client may only hold a single subscription for each unique topic at any\n\t * given time. When attempting to create a duplicate subscription,\n\t * the server will close the existing channel, log a warning, and\n\t * spawn a new channel for the topic. The client will have their\n\t * `channel.onClose` callbacks fired for the existing channel, and the new\n\t * channel join will have its receive hooks processed as normal.\n\t *\n\t * ## Pushing Messages\n\t *\n\t * From the previous example, we can see that pushing messages to the server\n\t * can be done with `channel.push(eventName, payload)` and we can optionally\n\t * receive responses from the push. Additionally, we can use\n\t * `receive(\"timeout\", callback)` to abort waiting for our other `receive` hooks\n\t *  and take action after some period of waiting. The default timeout is 5000ms.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ## Socket Hooks\n\t *\n\t * Lifecycle events of the multiplexed connection can be hooked into via\n\t * `socket.onError()` and `socket.onClose()` events, ie:\n\t *\n\t * ```javascript\n\t *     socket.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error with the connection!\") )\n\t *     socket.onClose( () => console.log(\"the connection dropped\") )\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ## Channel Hooks\n\t *\n\t * For each joined channel, you can bind to `onError` and `onClose` events\n\t * to monitor the channel lifecycle, ie:\n\t *\n\t * ```javascript\n\t *     channel.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error!\") )\n\t *     channel.onClose( () => console.log(\"the channel has gone away gracefully\") )\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ### onError hooks\n\t *\n\t * `onError` hooks are invoked if the socket connection drops, or the channel\n\t * crashes on the server. In either case, a channel rejoin is attempted\n\t * automatically in an exponential backoff manner.\n\t *\n\t * ### onClose hooks\n\t *\n\t * `onClose` hooks are invoked only in two cases. 1) the channel explicitly\n\t * closed on the server, or 2). The client explicitly closed, by calling\n\t * `channel.leave()`\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ## Presence\n\t *\n\t * The `Presence` object provides features for syncing presence information\n\t * from the server with the client and handling presences joining and leaving.\n\t *\n\t * ### Syncing initial state from the server\n\t *\n\t * `Presence.syncState` is used to sync the list of presences on the server\n\t * with the client's state. An optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callback can\n\t * be provided to react to changes in the client's local presences across\n\t * disconnects and reconnects with the server.\n\t *\n\t * `Presence.syncDiff` is used to sync a diff of presence join and leave\n\t * events from the server, as they happen. Like `syncState`, `syncDiff`\n\t * accepts optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callbacks to react to a user\n\t * joining or leaving from a device.\n\t *\n\t * ### Listing Presences\n\t *\n\t * `Presence.list` is used to return a list of presence information\n\t * based on the local state of metadata. By default, all presence\n\t * metadata is returned, but a `listBy` function can be supplied to\n\t * allow the client to select which metadata to use for a given presence.\n\t * For example, you may have a user online from different devices with\n\t * a metadata status of \"online\", but they have set themselves to \"away\"\n\t * on another device. In this case, the app may choose to use the \"away\"\n\t * status for what appears on the UI. The example below defines a `listBy`\n\t * function which prioritizes the first metadata which was registered for\n\t * each user. This could be the first tab they opened, or the first device\n\t * they came online from:\n\t *\n\t * ```javascript\n\t *     let state = {}\n\t *     state = Presence.syncState(state, stateFromServer)\n\t *     let listBy = (id, {metas: [first, ...rest]}) => {\n\t *       first.count = rest.length + 1 // count of this user's presences\n\t *       first.id = id\n\t *       return first\n\t *     }\n\t *     let onlineUsers = Presence.list(state, listBy)\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### Example Usage\n\t *```javascript\n\t *     // detect if user has joined for the 1st time or from another tab/device\n\t *     let onJoin = (id, current, newPres) => {\n\t *       if(!current){\n\t *         console.log(\"user has entered for the first time\", newPres)\n\t *       } else {\n\t *         console.log(\"user additional presence\", newPres)\n\t *       }\n\t *     }\n\t *     // detect if user has left from all tabs/devices, or is still present\n\t *     let onLeave = (id, current, leftPres) => {\n\t *       if(current.metas.length === 0){\n\t *         console.log(\"user has left from all devices\", leftPres)\n\t *       } else {\n\t *         console.log(\"user left from a device\", leftPres)\n\t *       }\n\t *     }\n\t *     let presences = {} // client's initial empty presence state\n\t *     // receive initial presence data from server, sent after join\n\t *     myChannel.on(\"presence_state\", state => {\n\t *       presences = Presence.syncState(presences, state, onJoin, onLeave)\n\t *       displayUsers(Presence.list(presences))\n\t *     })\n\t *     // receive \"presence_diff\" from server, containing join/leave events\n\t *     myChannel.on(\"presence_diff\", diff => {\n\t *       presences = Presence.syncDiff(presences, diff, onJoin, onLeave)\n\t *       this.setState({users: Presence.list(room.presences, listBy)})\n\t *     })\n\t * ```\n\t * @module phoenix\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar VSN = \"2.0.0\";\n\tvar SOCKET_STATES = {

Here's an example chat room example where `\"new_msg\"`\n * events are listened for, messages are pushed to the server, and\n * the channel is joined with ok/error/timeout matches:\n *\n * ```javascript\n *     let channel = socket.channel(\"room:123\", {token: roomToken})\n *     channel.on(\"new_msg\", msg => console.log(\"Got message\", msg) )\n *     $input.onEnter( e => {\n *       channel.push(\"new_msg\", {body: e.target.val}, 10000)\n *        .receive(\"ok\", (msg) => console.log(\"created message\", msg) )\n *        .receive(\"error\", (reasons) => console.log(\"create failed\", reasons) )\n *        .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue...\") )\n *     })\n *     channel.join()\n *       .receive(\"ok\", ({messages}) => console.log(\"catching up\", messages) )\n *       .receive(\"error\", ({reason}) => console.log(\"failed join\", reason) )\n *       .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue. Still waiting...\") )\n *```\n *\n * ## Joining\n *\n * Creating a channel with `socket.channel(topic, params)`, binds the params to\n * `channel.params`, which are sent up on `channel.join()`.\n * Subsequent rejoins will send up the modified params for\n * updating authorization params, or passing up last_message_id information.\n * Successful joins receive an \"ok\" status, while unsuccessful joins\n * receive \"error\".\n *\n * ## Duplicate Join Subscriptions\n *\n * While the client may join any number of topics on any number of channels,\n * the client may only hold a single subscription for each unique topic at any\n * given time. When attempting to create a duplicate subscription,\n * the server will close the existing channel, log a warning, and\n * spawn a new channel for the topic. The client will have their\n * `channel.onClose` callbacks fired for the existing channel, and the new\n * channel join will have its receive hooks processed as normal.\n *\n * ## Pushing Messages\n *\n * From the previous example, we can see that pushing messages to the server\n * can be done with `channel.push(eventName, payload)` and we can optionally\n * receive responses from the push. Additionally, we can use\n * `receive(\"timeout\", callback)` to abort waiting for our other `receive` hooks\n *  and take action after some period of waiting. The default timeout is 5000ms.\n *\n *\n * ## Socket Hooks\n *\n * Lifecycle events of the multiplexed connection can be hooked into via\n * `socket.onError()` and `socket.onClose()` events, ie:\n *\n * ```javascript\n *     socket.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error with the connection!\") )\n *     socket.onClose( () => console.log(\"the connection dropped\") )\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ## Channel Hooks\n *\n * For each joined channel, you can bind to `onError` and `onClose` events\n * to monitor the channel lifecycle, ie:\n *\n * ```javascript\n *     channel.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error!\") )\n *     channel.onClose( () => console.log(\"the channel has gone away gracefully\") )\n * ```\n *\n * ### onError hooks\n *\n * `onError` hooks are invoked if the socket connection drops, or the channel\n * crashes on the server. In either case, a channel rejoin is attempted\n * automatically in an exponential backoff manner.\n *\n * ### onClose hooks\n *\n * `onClose` hooks are invoked only in two cases. 1) the channel explicitly\n * closed on the server, or 2). The client explicitly closed, by calling\n * `channel.leave()`\n *\n *\n * ## Presence\n *\n * The `Presence` object provides features for syncing presence information\n * from the server with the client and handling presences joining and leaving.\n *\n * ### Syncing initial state from the server\n *\n * `Presence.syncState` is used to sync the list of presences on the server\n * with the client's state. An optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callback can\n * be provided to react to changes in the client's local presences across\n * disconnects and reconnects with the server.\n *\n * `Presence.syncDiff` is used to sync a diff of presence join and leave\n * events from the server, as they happen. Like `syncState`, `syncDiff`\n * accepts optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callbacks to react to a user\n * joining or leaving from a device.\n *\n * ### Listing Presences\n *\n * `Presence.list` is used to return a list of presence information\n * based on the local state of metadata. By default, all presence\n * metadata is returned, but a `listBy` function can be supplied to\n * allow the client to select which metadata to use for a given presence.\n * For example, you may have a user online from different devices with\n * a metadata status of \"online\", but they have set themselves to \"away\"\n * on another device. In this case, the app may choose to use the \"away\"\n * status for what appears on the UI. The example below defines a `listBy`\n * function which prioritizes the first metadata which was registered for\n * each user. This could be the first tab they opened, or the first device\n * they came online from:\n *\n * ```javascript\n *     let state = {}\n *     state = Presence.syncState(state, stateFromServer)\n *     let listBy = (id, {metas: [first, ...rest]}) => {\n *       first.count = rest.length + 1 // count of this user's presences\n *       first.id = id\n *       return first\n *     }\n *     let onlineUsers = Presence.list(state, listBy)\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Example Usage\n *```javascript\n *     // detect if user has joined for the 1st time or from another tab/device\n *     let onJoin = (id, current, newPres) => {\n *       if(!current){\n *         console.log(\"user has entered for the first time\", newPres)\n *       } else {\n *         console.log(\"user additional presence\", newPres)\n *       }\n *     }\n *     // detect if user has left from all tabs/devices, or is still present\n *     let onLeave = (id, current, leftPres) => {\n *       if(current.metas.length === 0){\n *         console.log(\"user has left from all devices\", leftPres)\n *       } else {\n *         console.log(\"user left from a device\", leftPres)\n *       }\n *     }\n *     let presences = {} // client's initial empty presence state\n *     // receive initial presence data from server, sent after join\n *     myChannel.on(\"presence_state\", state => {\n *       presences = Presence.syncState(presences, state, onJoin, onLeave)\n *       displayUsers(Presence.list(presences))\n *     })\n *     // receive \"presence_diff\" from server, containing join/leave events\n *     myChannel.on(\"presence_diff\", diff => {\n *       presences = Presence.syncDiff(presences, diff, onJoin, onLeave)\n *       this.setState({users: Presence.list(room.presences, listBy)})\n *     })\n
