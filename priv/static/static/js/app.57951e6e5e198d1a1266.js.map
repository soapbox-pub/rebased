This theme engine tries to solve all of the\n * common problems with themes.\n *\n * You don't have redefine several similar colors if you just want to\n * change one color - all color slots are derived from other ones, so you\n * can have at least one or two \"basic\" colors defined and have all other\n * components inherit and modify basic ones.\n *\n * You don't have to test contrast ratio for colors or pick text color for\n * each element even if you have light-on-dark elements in dark-on-light\n * theme.\n *\n * You don't have to maintain order of code for inheriting slots from othet\n * slots - dependency graph resolving does it for you.\n */\n\n/* This indicates that this version of code outputs similar theme data and\n * should be incremented if output changes - for instance if getTextColor\n * function changes and older themes no longer render text colors as\n * author intended previously.\n */\nexport const CURRENT_VERSION = 3\n\nexport const getLayersArray = (layer, data = LAYERS) => {\n  let array = [layer]\n  let parent = data[layer]\n  while (parent) {\n    array.unshift(parent)\n    parent = data[parent]\n  }\n  return array\n}\n\nexport const getLayers = (layer, variant = layer, opacitySlot, colors, opacity) => {\n  return getLayersArray(layer).map((currentLayer) => ([\n    currentLayer === layer\n      ? colors[variant]\n      : colors[currentLayer],\n    currentLayer === layer\n      ? opacity[opacitySlot] || 1\n      : opacity[currentLayer]\n  ]))\n}\n\nconst getDependencies = (key, inheritance) => {\n  const data = inheritance[key]\n  if (typeof data === 'string' && data.startsWith('--')) {\n    return [data.substring(2)]\n  } else {\n    if (data === null) return []\n    const { depends, layer, variant } = data\n    const layerDeps = layer\n      ? getLayersArray(layer).map(currentLayer => {\n        return currentLayer === layer\n          ? variant || layer\n          : currentLayer\n      })\n      : []\n    if (Array.isArray(depends)) {\n      return [...depends, ...layerDeps]\n    } else {\n      return [...layerDeps]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * Sorts inheritance object topologically - dependant slots come after\n * dependencies\n *\n * @property {Object} inheritance - object defining the nodes\n * @property {Function} getDeps - function that returns dependencies for\n *   given value and inheritance object.\n * @returns {String[]} keys of inheritance object, sorted in topological\n *   order.
