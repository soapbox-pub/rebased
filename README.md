![Rebased](rebased.png)

**Rebased** is a Fediverse backend written in Elixir.
It's compatible with the Mastodon API and is the recommended backend for Soapbox.

## Your social media server

Rebased empowers people to take control of their social media experience.
Hosting your own server means that *you* get to decide the rules.

Rebased connects to over 4,000 other servers on the Fediverse.
It is designed to spread your message far and wide, while being resilient to deplatforming.

## Installation
