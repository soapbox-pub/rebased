**Soapbox** is a federated social media server with a focus on user experience.
It is based on [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/).

## Your social media server

Soapbox empowers people to take control of their social media experience.
Hosting your own server means that *you* get to decide the rules.

Soapbox connects to over 4,000 other servers on the Fediverse.
It is designed to spread your message far and wide, while being resilient to deplatforming.
