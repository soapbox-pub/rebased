For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n *\n *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n *\n * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n *\n * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n *\n * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n * if it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n *\n *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n *\n * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n *\n * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n *\n *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n *     }\n *\n * All Immutable collections are Value Objects: they implement `equals()`\n * and `hashCode()`.\n */\n\n\nfunction is(valueA, valueB) {\n  if (valueA === valueB || valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB) {\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' && typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n    valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n    valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n\n    if (valueA === valueB || valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return !!(isValueObject(valueA) && isValueObject(valueB) && valueA.equals(valueB));\n}\n\nvar imul = typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2 ?

The throttled function comes with a `cancel`\n * method to cancel delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to\n * immediately invoke them. Provide `options` to indicate whether `func`\n * should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait`\n * timeout. The `func` is invoked with the last arguments provided to the\n * throttled function. Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the\n * result of the last `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the throttled function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.throttle` and `_.debounce`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to throttle.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to throttle invocations to.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new throttled function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid excessively updating the position while scrolling.\n * jQuery(window).on('scroll', _.throttle(updatePosition, 100));\n *\n * // Invoke `renewToken` when the click event is fired, but not more than once every 5 minutes.\n * var throttled = _.throttle(renewToken, 300000, { 'trailing': false });\n * jQuery(element).on('click', throttled);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing throttled invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', throttled.cancel);\n */\n\nfunction throttle(func, wait, options) {\n  var leading = true,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = 'leading' in options ? !!options.leading : leading;\n    trailing = 'trailing' in options ? !!options.trailing : trailing;\n  }\n\n  return debounce(func, wait, {\n    'leading': leading,\n    'maxWait': wait,\n    'trailing': trailing\n  });\n}\n\nmodule.exports = throttle;","import { __assign, __spreadArrays } from \"tslib\";\nimport { IntlMessageFormat } from 'intl-messageformat';\nimport * as memoize from 'fast-memoize';\nimport { UnsupportedFormatterError } from './error';\nexport function filterProps(props, whitelist, defaults) {\n  if (defaults === void 0) {\n    defaults = {};\n  }\n\n  return whitelist.reduce(function (filtered, name) {\n    if (name in props) {\n      filtered[name] = props[name];\n    } else if (name in defaults) {\n      filtered[name] = defaults[name];\n    }\n\n    return filtered;\n  }, {});\n}\n\nvar defaultErrorHandler = function defaultErrorHandler(error) {\n  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n    console.error(error);\n  }\n};\n\nexport var DEFAULT_INTL_CONFIG = {\n  formats: {},\n  messages: {},\n  timeZone: undefined,\n  defaultLocale: 'en',\n  defaultFormats: {},\n  onError: defaultErrorHandler\n};\nexport function createIntlCache() {\n  return {\n    dateTime: {},\n    number: {},\n    message: {},\n    relativeTime: {},\n    pluralRules: {},\n    list: {},\n    displayNames: {}\n  };\n}\n\nfunction createFastMemoizeCache(store) {\n  return {\n    create: function create() {\n      return {\n        has: function has(key) {\n          return key in store;\n        },\n        get: function get(key) {\n          return store[key];\n        },\n        set: function set(key, value) {\n          store[key] = value;\n        }\n      };\n    }\n  };\n} // @ts-ignore this is to deal with rollup's default import shenanigans\n\n\nvar _memoizeIntl = memoize.default || memoize;\n\nvar memoizeIntl = _memoizeIntl;\n/**\n * Create intl formatters and populate cache\n * @param cache explicit cache to prevent leaking memory\n */\n\nexport function createFormatters(cache) {\n  if (cache === void 0) {\n    cache = createIntlCache();\n  }\n\n  var RelativeTimeFormat = Intl.RelativeTimeFormat;\n  var ListFormat = Intl.ListFormat;\n  var DisplayNames = Intl.DisplayNames;\n  var getDateTimeFormat = memoizeIntl(function () {\n    var _a;\n\n    var args = [];\n\n    for (var _i = 0;
